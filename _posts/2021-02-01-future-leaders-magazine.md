"Your success in life lies not only with what you can ascertain for yourself, but the abundance of change, knowledge and advice you impart to the next generation.

That is how we progress as a race. By thinking bigger than ourselves, by appreciating the importance of offering to someone younger what you potentially may have not had yourself, by leading them forward and nurturing their unwavering focus and passion to guide it into a place of unprecedented achievement."

 Thank you to Adenike Adenitire and the team at Powerlist Magazine for organising such an empowering celebration event this week, featuring the likes of: Femi Oguns, J.P. Morgan, Latham & Watkins and Royal Air Force (RAF).

 My article entitled *"Teach One to Reach One..."*:

*"In August 2017 I was nearing the beginning of my time at sixth-form, eager and keen to make an impact in this next phase of my life. My flourishing interest in physics at the time was the perfect catalyst for focus and provided a productive avenue to channel my efforts to learn and explore. I distinctively remember approaching my physics teacher excited about the prospect of joining the school Physics society, only to be told that one didn’t exist and never had. After a period of disappointment, I took it upon myself to reach back out to the teacher. “Would it be possible to launch my own society?”. At first, he was hesitant of its potential success, but he did agree it was possible if I put in the time, effort and consistency.*

*My aim with this society was to inspire younger students in the school to question the workings of the everyday world and far beyond into the depths of space and time. Why does time run at different speeds at different places? If our universe is infinite, does that mean there’s another version of you somewhere out there? What would happen if you fell into a black hole? What is our purpose in the universe and are we alone? It was questions like these that my committee and I would pose in open discussion following each of my weekly presentations about a historic scientific discovery. Watching the eyes of the younger students light up as they realised the wonderment of our universe, or finally cracked a concept they had been struggling with was truly rewarding. With a strong weekly attendance and several students being inspired to further pursue physics at a deeper level, this experience gave me my first taste of the potential success of reaching out to give.*

*Since joining Oxford, I have participated in my old sixth form’s “Oxbridge Symposium” where I spoke as a guest. Following this I thought it would be brilliant to produce a YouTube video outlining advice for applying and demystifying misconceptions. Throughout this first year I have also been mentoring three current sixth form students in the journeys to Oxford, acting as the role model and guide I so desperately would have cherished whilst applying myself.*

*What is the importance of teaching and reaching out to younger students? Paying it forward. Your success in life lies not only with what you can ascertain for yourself, but the abundance of change, knowledge and advice you impart to the next generation. That is how we progress as a race. By thinking bigger than ourselves, by appreciating the importance of offering to someone younger what you potentially may have not had yourself, by leading them forward and nurturing their unwavering focus and passion to guide it into a place of unprecedented achievement.*

*These experiences have unlocked significant parts of my character and made me much more giving and driven to help. These past experiences have been truly rewarding and I now actively reach out to younger students as a personal mentor and Oxbridge application mentor; however, I hope my ability to advise will soon span over a vast array of areas of life."*

Congratulations to all the other Future Leaders selected this year!
