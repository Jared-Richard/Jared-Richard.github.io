“Tuesdays with Morrie” is a short book describing how Mitch Albom’s relationship with Morris Schwartz develops during his final 6 months battling the AlS disease. We are taken on a journey with these two characters as Morrie suffers through ALS aged 78, causing him to reflect on his life and the meaning of death, whilst imparting wisdom and advice to his younger friend Mitch.

Mitch left high school a year early and soon found himself out of his depth in college, surrounded by older students. Baggy tracksuits, blaring music from his car and walking around with a cigarette in his mouth he describes were fronts for his feelings of fear in this new environment. Morrie on the other hand was a teacher like no other. Instead of pretending to be something he was not, he was as open as they come, filled with joy and happiness and strived to connect deeply with his students. It is this juxtaposition that drew Mitch and Morrie together in an unexpected friendship that would carry Mitch through his college years and to pursue an honorary thesis after following Morrie’s guidance. Graduation sadly saw Mitch and Morrie part ways, and although Mitch promised he would stay in touch, he never did. 16 years later Morrie was featured on the TV show ‘Nightline” due to his newfound disease and the impact it was having on his life. As luck would have it, Mitch happened to be watching and was instantly moved to reach out and rekindle their friendship in the last 6 months of life Morrie had left to offer. This is where their journey starts.

The recurring themes in this book are the importance of love, forgiveness, compassion, being present, finding meaning and giving to others. Morrie often is found quoting from his favourite author W.H. Auden “Love each other or perish”. I often do find myself very focussed on work, as did Mitch in this book; hence, it was interesting to read Morrie’s perspective on finding balance in life. Focussing more on offering to others, sharing stories and building your community. Take time to listen to your loved ones while they are still close, be present when someone is talking to you. Truly listen to what they are saying. You find meaning in your life by devoting yourself to loving others and your community and creating something that gives you a purpose. I think the most important message from this book is to take time to reflect. Reflect on your character, how you treat others, what you spend your time consuming, what are you adding to the world. Focus less on holding grudges or maintaining an ego. Forgive and look for the positives, love each other.

I give thanks to my friend Ella who recommended this book to me. It did move me and triggered a long period of self reflection regarding my relationships with family members and friends and how I can be a better human to others. I too would recommend this book as a must read.

An interesting passage:

“Sometimes you cannot believe what you see, sometimes you have to believe what you feel. And if you are ever going to have other people trust you, you must feel that you can trust them, too – even when you’re in the dark, even when you’re falling.”

Another interesting passage:

“In the South American rainforest, there is a tribe called the Desana, who see the world as a fixed quantity of energy that flows between all creatures. Every birth must therefore engender a death, and every death bring forth another birth. This way, the energy of the world remains complete. When they hunt for food, the Desana know that the animals they kill will leave a hol;e in the spiritual well. But that hole will be filled, they believe, by the souls of the Desana hunters when they die. Were there no men dying, there would be no birds or fish being born. I like this idea. Morrie likes it, too. The closer he gets to good-bye, the more he seems to feel we are all creatures in the same forest. What we take, we must replenish.”

My favourite quotes from the book:

A teacher affects eternity, he can never tell where his influence stops.
Henry Adams

Once you learn how to die, you learn how to live.
Morris Schwartz

Fate succumbs many a species: one alone jeopardises itself.
W. H. Auden
