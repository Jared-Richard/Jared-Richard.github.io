 This work, in collaboration with Oxford University and CERN, was completed alongside my A-level studies. 

Through rigorous analysis and finding substantial evidence for its existence, my research was awarded a Distinction, selected as a winner of the *Oxford Physics “Higgs Hunters” 2019 Research Competition* and awarded First Prize for the annual *Haberdashers’ Aske’s Research Project Competition*, selected as 1st from over 150 entries.

Before presenting my project at the celebration assembly, I sat a viva examination with an external Physics professor to discuss the scope of my project. Below are his comments:

This research was an extension of my submission for the Oxford Physics 'Higgs Hunters' competition. As a result of being selected as a winner, I was honoured to be invited to present my findings over a two day conference at Oxford. Here is a video of the event:
