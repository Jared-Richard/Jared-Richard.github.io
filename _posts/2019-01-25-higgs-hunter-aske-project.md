title: Oxford Physics Research Competition & Haberdasher's Aske Project - First Prize Winner
category: physics
---

At age 16, I completed a 6-month independent research project into the potential existence of an undiscovered fundamental particle. This work, in conjunction with Oxford University and CERN, was completed alongside my A-level studies. Through rigorous analysis and finding substantial evidence for its existence, my research was awarded a Distinction, selected as a winner of the “Higgs Hunters” 2019 Oxford Physics Research Competition and also won First Prize for the annual Haberdashers’ Aske’s Research Project Competition, selected as 1st from over 150 entries.

Before presenting my project at the celebration assembly, I sat a viva examination with an external Physics professor to discuss the scope of my project. Below are his comments:

This research was an extension of my submission for the Oxford Physics 'Higgs Hunters' competition. As a result of being selected as a winner, I was honoured to be invited to present my findings over a two day conference at Oxford. Here is a video of the event:
