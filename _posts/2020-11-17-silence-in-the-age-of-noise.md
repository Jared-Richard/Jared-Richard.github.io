Erling Kagge, A previous Cambridge Philosophy student turned explorer, speaks of his 50 day expedition across Antarctica… with a broken radio. He envelops us in the silence he experienced, and uses this as a powerful tool to convince us of the benefits it can have in each of our lives.

The modern day has killed our attention spans. With such easy access to our phones, laptops, the internet, music etc. we provide ourselves a quick route away from boredom. Seldom do we find ourselves sitting in complete silence by ourselves and just thinking. Whilst this may not seem detrimental, it hinders our ability to intensely concentrate, truly listen when others are speaking and also find inner peace. In a study by the universities of Harvard and Virginia, scientists left individuals in a room alone for 15 minutes without their phones, music and reading or writing material. The researchers took this a step further and wanted to see if the individuals would rather experience something unpleasant, such as receive an electric shock, than sit alone with their thoughts. According to the researchers, being alone with one’s own thoughts ‘was apparently so aversive that it drove many participants to self-administer an electric shock that they had earlier said they would pay to avoid’. One participant pushed the button 190 times. Whilst this experiment may seem extreme and the theme easy to brush off as just the way life is, there are a select few, Kagge and myself included, who wish to challenge this.

So how do we change this and find silence in our busy fast-paced lives? Kagge says ‘You cannot wait for it to get quiet. Not in New York, nor anywhere else. You must create your own silence’. This can mean a 50 day expedition across the south pole, but it can also mean stopping at your desk, closing your eyes and slowly breathing in through your nose and out through your mouth. It can mean going on a walk and leaving your phone at home, it can also mean immersing yourself is such a passionate activity that you are fully present, ignoring regrets about the past and fear of the future. The overarching theme Kagge is trying to drive home in this book is we can derive more purpose and meaning from our lives by finding silence in the age of noise. By going inwards instead of trying to keep up with what is outwards.

Highlights:

The starry sky ‘is the truest friend in life, when you’ve first become acquainted ; it is ever there, it gives ever peace, ever reminds you that your restlessness, your doubt, your pains are passing trivialities. The universe is and will remain unshaken. Our opinions, our struggles, our sufferings are not so important and unique, when all is said and done.’

‘Silence is more of an idea. A notion. The silence around us may contain a lot, but the most interesting kind of silence is the one that lies within. A silence which each of us must create. I no longer try to create absolute silence around me. The silence that I am after is the silence within.’

‘I believe it’s possible for everyone to discover this silence within themselves. It is there all the time, even when we are surrounded by constant noise. Deep down in the ocean, below the waves and ripples, you can find your internal silence. Standing in the shower, letting the water wash over your head, sitting in front of a crackling fire, swimming across a forest lake or taking a walk over a field: all these can be experiences of perfect stillness too. I love that.’
