title: Why Physics?
category: physics

I hated Physics. All through my time at school. This was up until early year 12 when by pure chance, my dad recommended I watch the film ‘Interstellar’ with him. Christopher Nolan’s interpretation of the blend between science and love instantly captivated me, and it was my first introduction to black holes, relativity, and time dilation.

I often take a step back and wonder, why are we all here? Tiny organisms in an ever-expanding infinite universe that harbours billions of galaxies, each with trillions of stars. A cosmic arena that contains a multitude of phenomena, spanning from the violent implosion of a dying star, to the innocent growth of a flower. Why?

I believe the meaning of life is to find our why we have been placed here. We all too often find ourselves consumed by daily trivialities, we must focus on bigger questions. As Stephen Hawking once said:

Look up at the stars, not down at your feet
Stephen Hawking

I am currently a Physics Undergraduate at the University of Oxford, with a deep interest in the subtleties physics shares with other aspects of life. Whether that be the quantum physics that powers all modern technology (e.g. the laptop I am typing this on), Quantitative Finance, Artificial Intelligence, Space Travel and much more.

During my life I hope to share this interest with others, particularly the younger generation. Our future lies in the stars, we must venture forth and explore.
