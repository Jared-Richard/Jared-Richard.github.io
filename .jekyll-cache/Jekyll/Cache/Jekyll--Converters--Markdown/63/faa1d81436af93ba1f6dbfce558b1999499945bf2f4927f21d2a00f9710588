I"Ê<p>At age 16, I completed a 6-month independent research project into the potential existence of an undiscovered fundamental particle. This work, in conjunction with Oxford University and CERN, was completed alongside my A-level studies.</p>

<p>Through rigorous analysis and finding substantial evidence for its existence, my research was awarded a Distinction, selected as a winner of the <em>Oxford Physics ‚ÄúHiggs Hunters‚Äù 2019 Research Competition</em> and also won First Prize for the annual <em>Haberdashers‚Äô Aske‚Äôs Research Project Competition</em>, selected as 1st from over 150 entries.</p>

<p>Before presenting my project at the celebration assembly, I sat a viva examination with an external Physics professor to discuss the scope of my project. Below are his comments:</p>

<p>This research was an extension of my submission for the Oxford Physics ‚ÄòHiggs Hunters‚Äô competition. As a result of being selected as a winner, I was honoured to be invited to present my findings over a two day conference at Oxford. Here is a video of the event:</p>
