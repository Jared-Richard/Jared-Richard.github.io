<p><em>‘Interstellar’ and The Information Paradox</em> is the title of my presentation, delivered to my fellow students and tutors as part of the 2nd Year Physics Presentations (a requirement in the Oxford Physics degree course). This talk was greatly received and I was thankfully awarded First Prize for it.</p>

<p>The talk is an exploration into Christopher Nolan’s 2015 blockbuster <em>Interstellar</em>, but more importantly the questions it throws up about modern physics.</p>

<p>In the film we see reference to information being extracted from a black hole. This is actually quite a famous paradox in Physics, namely ‘The Information Paradox’ and was birthed from Stephen Hawking’s revolutionary ideas about Black Holes and Quantum Mechanics in 1974.</p>

<p>He showed that black holes ‘evaporate’ and shrink over time down to nothing. The problem lies in the fact nothing can leave a black hole once it has entered, so if an object fell in, the black hole shrinks and disappears, then the information of the object would be lost?</p>

<p>This wouldn’t be problem, apart from the fact that one of the most fundamental tenets in quantum physics, and physics in general, is that information can never be destroyed.</p>

<p>A potential solution was presented by Leonard Susskind and Gerard T’Hooft called ‘Black Hole Complementarity’ in which they say the inside and the outside of a black hole are 2 completely different situations, so we can treat them separately.</p>

<p>For observer A that falls into the black hole, they take their information with them, never to return (continuously falling down to the singularity at the center, maybe eventually leaving this simulation we live in). For observer B, a different observer who watches on from far away, they never see observer A truly enter, they see them “freeze” at the surface due to time dilation and their information is then spread over the surface and later reradiated back out as Hawking Radiation.</p>
