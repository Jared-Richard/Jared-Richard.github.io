<p>I loved this books honest and intriguing description of selection for 21 SAS (Special Air Service) - a Special Forces branch of the UKâ€™s military.</p>

<p>It describes a process that lasts well over a year, first beginning with increasingly difficult treks across hills in the Brecon Beacons. Then moves onto TQ - <em>tactical questioning</em> (i.e. interrogation), and then â€˜continuationâ€™ phase for another few months. On a standard selection round, 200+ men will start, around 10 will finish. Here, Adam Ballinger narrates his own successful experience back in the 1980s. (Interesting point: Adam and several other of the remaining 10 were were previous oxbridge graduates (including a physics student - Avery) and, according to Avery, â€˜the reason the SAS badge is a mixture of light and dark blue is because there were so many Oxbridge graduates in the original regimentâ€™).</p>

<p>Summary: thoroughly enjoyed this book and would be interested in learning more about military life and special forces in the UK.</p>

<h3>Quotes &amp; Passages:</h3>

<p><em>â€˜For a young man who wants to enjoy himself, to spend a few years agreeably in military companionship â€¦ the British cavalry will be suited â€¦ To the youth who means to make himself a professional soldier, an expert in war, a specialist in practical tactics, who desires a hard life of adventure and a true comradeship in arms, I would recommend the choice of some regiment on the frontier.â€™</em> - Winston Churchill</p>

<p><em>â€˜It is not good to be too free. It is not good to have all one needs.â€™</em> - Pascal</p>

<p><em>â€˜It is not in manâ€™s nature to always go in one direction; it has its ups and downs.â€™</em> - Pascal</p>

<p><em>â€˜Donâ€™t get too despondent,â€™ he said, looking downcast. â€˜We all improve with time. In this regiment youâ€™ve got to shoot a fly off a dogâ€™s bollocks at four hundred yards.â€™</em></p>

<p><em>â€˜A tattoo is a mine of information. A man with a tattoo is a walking encyclopedia.â€™</em></p>

<p><em>â€˜Service life in this way teaches man to live largely on little.â€™</em> - T. E. Lawrence</p>

<p><em>â€˜Some of you will know Wood. He was trying to join Two Squadron. Heâ€™s just been dropped from this course. He had a criminal record. It wouldnâ€™t matter, lads, but he said he didnâ€™t. Thatâ€™s why we ask you on attestation. It catches up with you eventually. Youâ€™ve got to tell the truth, lads. This regiment does not tolerate liars. When you come back from an exercise weâ€™ve got to be able to rely on your word. Peopleâ€™s lives may depend on it.â€™</em></p>

<p><em>â€˜Well done, lads,â€™ the Colonel said. â€˜Itâ€™s hard to get into this regiment. But as your OCâ€™s already told you, itâ€™s even harder to stay in it. But well done â€“ well done. â€˜Iâ€™ve done some statistics and the results will interest you. Thirty per cent of you will leave within three years. One of you will go on to command a squadron and one of you will disgrace himself, and be dismissed from the regiment, within the first year.â€™</em></p>

<p><em>â€˜Finding the right men,â€™ said Falstaff, â€˜is like looking for diamonds. During Selection we knock away the bad rock until a rough diamond is found. Camp is a cutting process when we chip off the bad edges. Continuation is the polish. Itâ€™s our job to present clean diamonds to the regiment.â€™ â€˜Can you spot the diamonds, in the rock, before the course begins?â€™ I asked. â€˜Yes, I can,â€™ said Falstaff, his eyes twinkling. â€˜Itâ€™s all in the eyes, and the mind. You remember having your photograph taken at the beginning of the course?â€™ â€˜On attestation?â€™â€˜Yes. We put them all together on a big sheet of cardboard. Iâ€™ve got a black pen and we cross out every face that will fail. Ninety-five per cent of the time weâ€™re right. Itâ€™s interesting to see them fall. Sometimes we put money on it. I can even tell when some of them will go. You can look at a man and say, â€œHeâ€™ll fail on weekend four, heâ€™ll fail on Long Drag and heâ€™ll fail on TQ.â€ You escaped the black pen, but Sampson is a surprise. We thought heâ€™d fail. Most muscle men do.â€™</em></p>

<p><em>â€˜Are you, then, so easily turned from your design? Did you not call this a glorious expedition? And wherefore was it glorious? Not because the way was smooth and placid as a southern sea, but because it was full of dangers and terror, because at every new incident your fortitude was to be called forth and your courage exhibited, because danger and death surrounded it, and these you were to brave and overcome. For this it was glorious, for this it was an honourable undertaking â€¦ Oh! Be men, or be more than men. Be steady to your purposes and firm as rock.â€™</em> - Mary Shelley</p>
