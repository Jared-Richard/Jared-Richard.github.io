<p>My name is Jared Richard, a Physics Undergraduate at the University of Oxford.</p>

<p>Self-teaching Python, Javascript, HTML and CSS alongside my university studies has driven me to build this academic website, as an area to upload coding projects, book reviews and more. Aside from my academic studies, I am actively involved in long-distance running, acting and mentoring.</p>

<!-- Throughout the majority of my time in education, from primary school to university, Iâ€™ve had the interesting challenge of balancing studies with a professional acting career. This started at 5 years old when my Mum took me to an open audition at Regents Park Open Air Theatre, where I was cast in â€œBabe The Sheep Pigâ€ as my first acting experience.

Years later I would find myself performing as William Frankenstein for 5 consecutive months in Danny Boyleâ€™s â€˜Frankensteinâ€˜ at The National Theatre. This included 4 evening performances per week balanced with my academic studies. Working with the likes of Benedict Cumberbatch, Jonny Lee Miller, Naomi Harris and Danny Boyle was a truly amazing experience and one I will always cherish.

More recently, over the last 5 years I have performed as the characters Marley and Jason in the German educational series â€˜Klettâ€™. The videos have not been officially released yet but screenshots will be coming soon. -->
