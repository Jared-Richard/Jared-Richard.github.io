I"ž<p>During winters I train for cross-country and in summers Iâ€™m on the track for 400m and 800m. Consistent training over several years with Harrow Athletics Club has given me the opportunity to represent them at the 2018 National Cross-Country Championships and the 2018 Harrow Half Marathon. I have now extended my training to cycling and swimming in preparation for forthcoming triathlons.</p>
