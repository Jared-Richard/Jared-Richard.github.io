<p>This work, in collaboration with Oxford University and CERN, was completed alongside my A-level studies.</p>

<p>Through rigorous analysis and finding substantial evidence for its existence, my research was awarded a Distinction, selected as a winner of the <em>Oxford Physics “Higgs Hunters” 2019 Research Competition</em> and awarded First Prize for the annual <em>Haberdashers’ Aske’s Research Project Competition</em>, selected as 1st from over 150 entries.</p>

<p>This research was an extension of my submission for the Oxford Physics ‘Higgs Hunters’ competition. As a result of being selected as a winner, I was honoured to be invited to present my findings over a two day conference at Oxford. Here is a video of the event:</p>
