My name is Jared Richard, a Physics Undergraduate at the University of Oxford. Through self-teaching Javascript, HTML, CSS and Python, I have built this academic website, and intend to post coding projects, book reviews and more. Aside from academic studies I am also actively involved in 
[sports]({{ site.baseurl }}{% /sports.md %}), [acting]({{ site.baseurl }}{% /acting.md %}) and [mentoring]({{ site.baseurl }}{% /mentoring.md %})

<a href="">sports</a>, <a href="">acting</a> and <a href="">mentoring</a>.
