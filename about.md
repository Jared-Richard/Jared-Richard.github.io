My name is Jared Richard and I am currently a Physics Undergraduate at the University of Oxford. During the 2020 COVID-19 lockdown I spent several months self-teaching Javascript, HTML, CSS and Python, and have now implemented these skills to build this website. My aim is for this to be an area where I can post coding projects, book reviews and more. Aside from academic studies I am also actively involved in sports, acting and mentoring.

ACTING

Throughout the majority of my time in education, from primary school to university, I’ve had the interesting challenge of balancing studies with a professional acting career. This started at 5 years old when my Mum took me to an open audition at Regents Park Open Air Theatre, where I was cast in “Babe The Sheep Pig” as my first acting experience.

Years later I would find myself performing as William Frankenstein for 5 consecutive months in Danny Boyle’s ‘Frankenstein‘ at The National Theatre. This included 4 evening performances per week balanced with my academic studies. Working with the likes of Benedict Cumberbatch, Jonny Lee Miller, Naomi Harris and Danny Boyle was a truly amazing experience and one I will always cherish.

More recently, over the last 5 years I have performed as the characters Marley and Jason in the German educational series ‘Klett’. The videos have not been officially released yet but screenshots will be coming soon.

SPORTS

During winters I train for cross-country and in summers I’m on the track for 400m and 800m. Consistent training over several years with Harrow Athletics Club has given me the opportunity to represent them at the 2018 National Cross-Country Championships and the 2018 Harrow Half Marathon. I have now extended my training to cycling and swimming in preparation for forthcoming triathlons.


MENTORING

In my free time I love to support younger individuals through mentoring. My first experience in this field was whilst at sixth form, where I was as a student mentor and would speak with younger students about personal issues that may possibly be affecting their work. I have continued this interest through to university where I am currently mentoring 10 students from my sixth form and the InvestIn Summer programme in their applications to Oxford University.
