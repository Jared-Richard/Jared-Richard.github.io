My name is Jared Richard, a Physics Undergraduate at the University of Oxford. I have built this academic website through self-teaching Javascript, HTML, CSS and Python. My aim is for this to be an area where I can post coding projects, book reviews and more. Aside from academic studies I am also actively involved in sports, acting and mentoring.
