title: Mentoring
---

In my free time I love to support younger individuals through mentoring. My first experience in this field was whilst at sixth form, where I was as a student mentor and would speak with younger students about personal issues that may possibly be affecting their work. I have continued this interest through to university where I am currently mentoring 10 students from my sixth form and the InvestIn Summer programme in their applications to Oxford University.
