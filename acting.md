Throughout the majority of my time in education, from primary school to university, I’ve had the interesting challenge of balancing studies with a professional acting career. This started at 5 years old when my Mum took me to an open audition at Regents Park Open Air Theatre, where I was cast in “Babe The Sheep Pig” as my first acting experience.

Years later I would find myself performing as William Frankenstein for 5 consecutive months in Danny Boyle’s ‘Frankenstein‘ at The National Theatre. This included 4 evening performances per week balanced with my academic studies. Working with the likes of Benedict Cumberbatch, Jonny Lee Miller, Naomi Harris and Danny Boyle was a truly amazing experience and one I will always cherish.

More recently, over the last 5 years I have performed as the characters Marley and Jason in the German educational series ‘Klett’. The videos have not been officially released yet but screenshots will be coming soon.
