<h1>Welcome</h1>

My name is Jared Richard and I'm currently a Physics Undergraduate at the University of Oxford. 

Self-teaching Python, Javascript, HTML and CSS alongside my university studies has driven me to build this academic website. My aim is for this site to be an area to share coding projects, discuss theories and ideas, post book reviews and more.
